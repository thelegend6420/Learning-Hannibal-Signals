{"name":"Learning-hannibal-signals","tagline":"Learning telecommunications signals","body":"Wind\r\n----\r\n\r\nWiND is a Web application targeting at [Wireless Community Networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_community_network).\r\nIt was created as a replacement for [NodeDB](http://www.nodedb.com/) by the members of [Athens Wireless Metropolitan Network](http://www.awmn.net/) located in Athens, Greece. It has evolved into much more as you can see below in the feature list.\r\n\r\nWiND is distributed under [GNU Affero General Public License v3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html) where each piece of code remains under the copyright of their respective author. Everyone can see the source code and everyone can contribute to it.\r\n\r\n## Caution ##\r\nThere have been changes in the Database. Please review the DB Schema before you try to use the current master source with your old installation. For your convenience there is an updater script in /tools that can only run in cli. It will try to update you db schema so be advised, **backup your DB First!** \r\n\r\n(Example) \r\nroot@myhost:/var/www/html/wind/tools/# **php update.php** \r\n\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n * Supports multiple users and multiple nodes per user\r\n * Supports controling of task authorization.\r\n * Stores all the node information a Wireless MAN will need: location, height, area, region, backbone & AP interfaces, roof view photos, subnets & hosts in a node etc.\r\n * Provides an easy (but powerful) way of searching for specific nodes\r\n * Using [NASA's SRTM data](http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/), it graphs the _Line of Sight_, and _Fresnel Zone_ between two nodes and calculates _Free Space Loss_ for the distance between them\r\n * Uses [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org/) to show the nodes and their links on map.\r\n * Can be used to manage the distribution of IP Ranges and forward/reverse DNS assigned to each node (_Hostmaster_)\r\n * Fully themeable interface (using simple (X)HTML templates)\r\n * Support for localication; Unicode/UTF-8 support\r\n * Supports provisioning of IPv4 and IPv6 address ranges. \r\n * Supports user logging per node for tracking.\r\n * Integrates with BIND Nameserver for serving the IPv4 DNS zones.\r\n * A WHOIS server is provided that serves the data using the [WHOIS protocol](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3912.html)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nYou can find latest documentation online on the [wiki of project](https://github.com/wind-project/wind/wiki)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
